# WATCH
The WATCH (in development) is a simple use item that will provide warmth for cats independently of human intervention.  It was designed to activate when and only when it is actually being used. Upon final implementation, the WATCH should benefit older cats in particular, as they may suffer from arthritis and other joint problems that cause discomfort.
<p>The initial prototype (v01) is a proof-of-concept of the WATCH’s warming and temperature safety functionalities, which are to initiate a warming element to provide comfort via application of weight (use by the cat) and to regulate the surface temperature to an acceptable range.</p>

  <li><b>Source Code</b><br>The MicroPython source code to be flashed onto the Micro:Bit.</li>
  <li><b>Circuit Diagram</b><br>Fritzing diagram of the project's circuit setup. The diagram is slightly modified from the actual build of the current project, but is labelled for clarity and will be updated with a more accurate setup upon creating custom Fritzing parts for KeyeStudio components. A separate repository for custom Fritzing parts is located <a href="https://github.com/ideocariza/Fritzing-Files.git">here</a>.</li>
